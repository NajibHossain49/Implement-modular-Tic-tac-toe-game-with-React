Here's a summary of what I've accomplished:

### Project Overview

I've built a complete Tic-tac-toe game using React with:

- A modular component architecture
- Clean separation of concerns
- Full game functionality with player turns, win detection, and history tracking

### Architecture Details

1. **Modular Design**: Each component is in its own file with a single responsibility
2. **Separation of Concerns**: UI components are separated from game logic
3. **Component Hierarchy**: Clear parent-child relationships between components
4. **State Management**: Game state handled in the main Game component

### Code Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Square.jsx
│   ├── Board.jsx
│   ├── GameHistory.jsx
│   └── GameStatus.jsx
├── utils/
│   └── gameLogic.jsx
├── Game.jsx
└── main.jsx
```

### Key Features

- Player turns (X and O)
- Win detection logic
- Draw detection
- Game history tracking
- Time travel to previous moves
- Game reset functionality
- Status messages
